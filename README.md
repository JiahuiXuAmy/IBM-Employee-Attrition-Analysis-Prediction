# Introduction

High employee attrition rates can profoundly affect organizations, resulting in higher recruitment and training expenses, lower productivity, and diminished employee morale. Understanding the factors driving attrition is crucial, prompting companies to take proactive measures. Developing a predictive model to classify employees at risk of leaving can be highly beneficial for companies.


# Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance dataset using Python. The project aims to gain valuable insights into the factors contributing to employee attrition and organizational performance through EDA. Additionally, we will build predictive models using various machine-learning algorithms to forecast employee attrition.
